## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains working implementations, notes, and examples for **SPPU’s Third Year SPOS curriculum**.  
Each file demonstrates core OS and systems programming concepts like **scheduling algorithms**, **macro processors**, **assemblers**, and **page replacement policies** — implemented in **Python**, **Java**, and **C**.

Use this repo to:
- Understand SPOS practicals conceptually and programmatically  
- Prepare for **university practical exams**  
- Learn by running and modifying real code examples
